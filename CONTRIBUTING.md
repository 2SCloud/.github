# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our projects
This document defines the general contribution rules that apply to all repositories within this organization.

Some repositories may define additional or more specific guidelines in their own README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md.
In case of conflict, repository-level rules take precedence.

---

## Scope

These guidelines apply to:

- All public and private repositories in this organization
- All contributors: maintainers, external contributors, and internal teams

---

## Types of Contributions

We welcome the following kinds of contributions:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Tests and test improvements
- Documentation updates
- Security and performance improvements
- Architectural discussions and proposals

---

## General Workflow

1. Fork the target repository
2. Create a branch from main (or develop if specified)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure tests pass and code is properly formatted
5. Commit your changes
6. Push your branch
7. Open a Pull Request

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One Pull Request should address one clear concern
- Use a clear and descriptive title
  Example: fix: prevent crash on invalid config
- Clearly describe:
  - what the problem is
  - how it was solved
  - any impact or breaking change
- Keep commits clean and focused
- Address review feedback before requesting merge

---

## Testing Expectations

- New features should include appropriate tests
- Existing tests must continue to pass
- If tests cannot be added, explain the reason in the PR description

---

## Code Quality and Style

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Format code before committing
- Avoid unrelated changes in the same PR
- Remove dead or commented-out code before submitting

---

## Commit Messages

We recommend (but do not strictly require) using commit messages inspired by Conventional Commits:

feat: add request rate limiting
fix: handle null pointer during startup
docs: clarify deployment instructions

---

## Security Issues

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public issues or pull requests.

If you discover a security issue:
- Contact the maintainers privately
- Follow the instructions provided in the repository or organization security policy

---

## Licensing

By contributing to any repository in this organization, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the license of the repository you are contributing to.

---

## Getting Help

If you need help or have questions:

- Read the repository README.md
- Check existing issues and pull requests
- Ask clear, constructive, and well-scoped questions
